HEVT is a four year undergraduate research project at Virginia Tech Mechanical Engineering Department. We have spent four years to convert a Chevy Camaro to a Hybrid Camaro to attend the ECOCar competition hold by General Motors. During this period, I worked as a mechanical subteam member in charge of electronic component cooling loop design, driveshaft vibration analysis and redesign, and fuel tank redesign.

Cooling Loop Redesign
Design the cooling loop for extra electronic components of a hybrid vehicle: DC-DC Converter and Inverter

Driveshaft Redesign
The dirveshaft need to be reshaped due to the electric motor. Previous driveshaft design cause high vibration and the new designed driveshaft solve the issue

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/driveshaft1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    First left two are the old driveshaft deisng. The center bearing cause severe vibration issue at speed of 40 mph. The newer design (right one) remove the center bearing and solve the vibration issue
