I am a Ph.D student in Virginia Tech with highly enthusiastic in autonomous vehicle, machine learning/deep learning algorithms, and robotics. I earned my Bachelor's Degree from Virginia Tech Mechanical Engineering Department at 2018 and continue my research on autonomous vehicle in Virginia Tech [ASIM Lab](https://asim.me.vt.edu/) with [Dr. Azim Eskandarian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mLc5_pcAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=13410158990364976897).

In the past, I have conducted my research on semi-truck lateral dynamic behavior and human cognitive state analysis for autonomous driving. 

Currently, my research focus is autonomous vehicle's sensor perception quality assessment and evaluation.
